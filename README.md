# 20th Century Flicks Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the 20th Century Flicks website rebuild! This project showcases my skills in Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Algolia, and the OMDb API. As a passionate film enthusiast, I took on the challenge of reimagining the original website, which had been in use for an impressive 15 years. The goal was to create a modern, efficient, and visually captivating experience for users to explore a vast collection of over 20,000 movies available for rental, both in-person and by post.
