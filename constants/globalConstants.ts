          Avenue which can be used as a parking space to drop off or pick up
          movies from the shop. The steps are uneven and there isn’t a handrail.
          This is because the street is historical and listed and can’t be
          changed! In the shop, we have chairs for customers. We have a urinal
          and a toilet at the shop. There is one step to the urinal and 5 to the
          toilet. The shop can be very busy on Saturdays, the weekdays are much
          quieter.`,

      "In Bristol, amidst the labyrinthine streets halfway up the Christmas Steps, nestles a modest video shop, a haven for those seeking cinematic treasures of the 20th century and beyond. Wooden shelves lined with VHS tapes, laserdiscs and blu-rays, faded movie posters adorn the walls, beckoning the weary souls of film enthusiasts. The proprietor or a skilled and kindly clerk will greet you and help you find the stories you seek.",
    para2:

Each cassette and case holds a world waiting to unfold, their faded covers hinting at the magic within.",

      "Hours slip away as customers meticulously choose their filmic companions, trading tales and recommendations with the staff in hushed tones, so as not to disturb the audience who maybe watching a movie in one of the tiny cinemas behind closed doors. Dust dances in the fading sunlight, casting an ethereal glow upon those who search for solace and inspiration.",

      "In this humble video shop, the films of the last 100 or so years find sanctuary, their stories preserved and shared with reverence. And as the sun sets behind St Michaels Hill, Bristol's cinematic tapestry grows richer, one borrowed VHS tape at a time.",
