          Colston Avenue and 25 steps down to the shop from Colston Street.
          There is a loading bay at the bottom of the Christmas Steps on Colston
          Avenue which can be used as a parking space to drop off or pick up
          movies from the shop. The steps are uneven and there isn’t a handrail.
          This is because the street is historical and listed and can’t be
          changed! In the shop, we have chairs for customers. We have a urinal
          and a toilet at the shop. There is one step to the urinal and 5 to the
          toilet. The shop can be very busy on Saturdays, the weekdays are much
          quieter.`,
